# Hello-everyone-I-m-Thyago-Pinheiro
Currently studying Mechanical Engineering at UFSCar - SP, Brazil. I like doing sports, especially running. I am also passionate about technology and am always looking to learn about new advances in the field. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to tech and trivia podcasts. I'm excited to meet new people and make new friends.
